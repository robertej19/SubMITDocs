\subsection{Description}
The SubMIT system was built to handle job submissions to MIT's Tier 2 (Bates) and Tier 3 (MIT) computing facilities, as well as a few other computing centers around the world. As of 2020, only MIT members have access to submit jobs through this system, but in the end it will need to be opened to all CLAS12 members to submit jobs through the online webportal extension.

    \subsection*{Python Versions}
        \indent We discussed that SubMIT only has python 2.6.6 and has not yet disclosed plans to upgrade / install python3. It was decided to try and write the code to work with python3 as much as possible as it works fine on OSG, SubMIT isn't used much presently, and python2.6 has security flaws.
    \subsection*{Other Notes}
        \indent Mauri and Bobby continue to try to work out python bindings with htcondor.

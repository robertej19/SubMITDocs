    Even with the above references, some details remained unclear. Here is a useful mapping from python binding commands to condor\_q outputs:\\
    \newline
    \textbf{job.get("ClusterID")} - we have called this different names, but is in the sql db as osg\_ID\\
    \textbf{job.get("JobStatus")} - returns if job is running /idle. See \href{http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~adesmet/status.html}{Status and State Numbers} for more.\\
    \textbf{job.get("QDate")} - utc unix timestamp of when the job was submitted.\\
    \textbf{job.get("TotalSubmitProcs")} - total number of jobs submitted. To get the number of jobs done, you must subtract all running and idle jobs from the total jobs, i.e. there does not exist a variable tracking how many jobs are done in the batch submission.\\
